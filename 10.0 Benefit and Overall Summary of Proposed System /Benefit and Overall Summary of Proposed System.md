## 10.0 Benefit and Overall Summary of Proposed System

<p>

KADA.gov.my is a system that we proposed to address the inefficiencies and limitations of the current manual registration process. Firstly, the system can enhance membership accessibility to broaden its reach and support a larger member base. The cooperative can broaden its potential membership base and reach more people by assessing the viability of introducing membership to the public. Additionally, digitizing Board of Directors meetings can significantly improve efficiency. By using a digital system for these meetings, it will be easier to keep track of minutes, make the sessions more transparent and efficient for all board members, and streamline record-keeping. 

Furthermore, the system's suggestion to streamline the loan approval and membership processes. The current manual processes should be evaluated and digitised to achieve faster processing times, lower member wait times, and increasing overall satisfaction. Effective communication lines between the cooperative and its members are crucial for keeping everyone up to date on their rights, benefits, and any policy changes. Finally, the members will find it easier to join and apply for loans at any time and from any location by adopting an online application system that will improve accessibility and speed the application process.  

Overall, the new online application system will significantly improve member satisfaction by simplifying the registration and loan application processes. The Lembaga Kemajuan Pertanian Kemubu will be in a better position to assist its members and accomplish the organization's goal of improving the socioeconomic status of farmers in the Kemubu region by implementing these reforms. This modernization initiative will also guarantee that KADA's cooperative is safe, secure, and responsive to the demands of its members.
