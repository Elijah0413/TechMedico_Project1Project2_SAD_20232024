## 2.1 Method used

First, we joined an industrial sharing program on 14 May 2024 through Webex platform where the KADA shared the detailed information on various aspects of their system. This information covered the topics such as the member registration process, loan application procedure, the loans available and the calculation of the loan. Additionally, we apply the observation method by access the KADA website to get more details of the system. The website provides addition information which allow us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current processes and procedures of the system. We also chose an unobtrusive approach of information collecting which is questionnaire, which aids in the collection of critical information on human and system requirements. For the questionnaire preparation, our group collaborated with other groups to prepare various questions, including open-ended and closed questions. By asking open-ended questions, we may go deeper into the user's requirements and find other potential issues with the current system. Then, to acquire more precise information, we conduct a questionnaire with management using closed-ended questions.
