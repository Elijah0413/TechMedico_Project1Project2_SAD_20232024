## Summary from method Used

We have concluded the interview with KADA management on May 14, 2024, with a summary. The goal of this sharing program is to acquire information about the background and concept of KADA cooperative. We discussed the cooperative's functioning, the types of loans they supplied, how to apply for a loan, how the loan gets authorized, what the repayment rate is, and so on. As a result of this meeting, we decided to present an online system for KADA cooperative that focuses on two major modules which are member registration and loans. In addition, we conducted an observation on the KADA cooperative's current website. The aim of this observation is to examine the workflow efficiency and identify any problems on the website. We discover that the website's navigation is challenging and the user struggles to understand how to use the system. Aside from this, the system lacks clarity. There are no clear instructions on how to apply for benefits; they merely supply a form and do not indicate any subsequent actions. We also noticed a delayed load time during our observation. For the questionnaire, our group prepared two questions for the surveyor. This questionnaire session allowed us to gain a better understanding of the client's system requirements. The client also provided some further clarifications on our idea.
