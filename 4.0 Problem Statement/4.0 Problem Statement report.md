The cooperative (koperasi) run by Lembaga Kemajuan Pertanian Kemubu (KADA) offers significant benefits to its employees, such as loans and a retirement fund. However, a cumbersome manual registration procedure and a restrictive membership limit are the cooperative's two main problems, which restrict its efficiency and accessibility. 

At this point, employees must fill out a manual form to register as a member of the KADA cooperative. This outdated method is hard to use and results in a lot of mistakes and inefficiency Employees must complete paper forms, which can be cumbersome and error prone. Employees are discouraged from enrolling by this cumbersome process as they may think it is too complex or inconvenient. Additionally, the registration form can only be found in Malay, which presents a major problem in increasing the number of employees registered under the cooperative. This is because they might be some employees do not know the Malay language well. The cooperative's reach is restricted by this linguistic barrier, which also decreases the benefits of KADA's diversity and accessibility. 

Apart from the registration process, which is cumbersome, there is a 500 members cap on the cooperative now. This restriction significantly limits the number of employees who may register as a member of the cooperatives. Many potential employees are unable to join and benefit from the cooperative's financial advantages since the workforce exceeds the membership the limit. Due to this restriction, KADA's employees is unable to take advantage of important loan activities and retirement savings plans that might improve their well-being and financial stability. The membership cap impacts not just the options available to individuals but also the cooperative's ability to develop and have an influence. 

The third main problem that KADA cooperative must overcome is the lack of month-end and year-end financial reports, which include profit and loss statements. Because members are unable to monitor the cooperative's financial status or the management of their contributions, the lack of financial transparency affects member confidence and involvement. Improving the cooperative's efficiency, dependability, and attraction for current and new members will involve solving this issue. 

These issues have wide-ranging consequences inefficiencies of the manual registration procedure, number of members restriction and system that doesn‚Äôt has a summary report inhibit employees from joining the cooperative. As a result, the cooperative's membership decreases and clients' general satisfaction with its services declines. Due to the difficulty and barrier to registration, employees who may profit from the cooperative's financial goods may be left out. Furthermore, this problem is made worse by the membership cap, which keeps many motivated employees from taking part, missing out on opportunities for money, and decreasing productivity. The cooperative's limited capacity to provide services to a larger portion of KADA's workforce reduces its chances for development and lowers its efficacy as a financial assistance system for employees.
