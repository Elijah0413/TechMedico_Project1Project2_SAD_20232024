## 6.0 Objective

<p>The primary objective of this project is to modernize and digitize Koperasi KADA's operations by following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology. 

  

In the Information Gathering phase, the goal is to collect comprehensive information about current processes, stakeholder needs, and system requirements. This involves conducting interviews, surveys, and reviewing existing documentation to identify pain points and areas for improvement.  

  

Following this, in the Conduct Analysis Based on the Information Gathered phase, the collected data will be analysed to understand the requirements and scope. This includes performing a gap analysis, defining functional and non-functional requirements, and prioritizing these requirements based on business impact.  

  

Next, in the Design Phase, the objective is to create detailed designs for the digital systems. This encompasses developing system architecture, user interfaces, and data models. The design documentation will then be reviewed with stakeholders to ensure it aligns with their requirements.  

  

The Implementation Phase involves developing and deploying the digital systems according to the design specifications. Integration with existing infrastructure, testing, and debugging will be carried out to ensure seamless operation.  

  

To ensure quality, the Testing and Quality Assurance phase will ensure that the digital systems are functional, reliable, and meet all specified requirements. This will involve conducting system testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to identify and fix defects.

Once the systems are ready, the Deployment and Launch phase will deploy the developed systems into the live environment. This phase includes providing training and support to end-users and monitoring the systems post-deployment for any issues. 

Finally, in the Maintenance and Evaluation phase, the systems will be maintained and their performance evaluated over time. Updates and improvements will be implemented as needed based on user feedback and performance metrics.
