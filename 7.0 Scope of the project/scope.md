## Scope
<p>
The digital transformation project for Koperasi KADA will have several limitations to ensure it remains manageable and focused. In terms of technology, the project will primarily concentrate on developing web-based solutions. While these systems will significantly enhance accessibility and streamline various processes, they will be limited to web applications only, excluding the development of mobile applications. Users will need access to a web browser to utilize the new digital systems, as mobile application development is not included within the project's scope. Additionally, all interactions and processes facilitated by the new systems will be conducted online, meaning any offline or manual processing requirements are outside the project's scope. Members and administrators must have internet access to participate in the cooperative's digital transformation. 

  

In terms of actors, the new digital systems will be designed for use by specific roles within Koperasi KADA, including the Board of Directors, administrative staff, committee members, and new cooperative members. These systems will cater to the needs of these user groups, ensuring they can efficiently perform their tasks within the cooperative's operations. The project will focus on optimizing at least five key processes: registering new members, simplifying the loan application and approval process, enhancing reporting capabilities, establishing effective communication channels, and digitizing board meetings to improve efficiency and record-keeping. 

  

These limitations are set to ensure that the project remains manageable and focused, providing clear boundaries within which the digital transformation efforts will be implemented. By concentrating on web-based solutions and specific user roles, Koperasi KADA can achieve meaningful improvements in their operations while laying a foundation for potential future expansions, such as mobile applications or offline capabilities.
